* Spargus Vehicle Prototype
This is a 3D vehicle game prototype inspired by the gameplay and feel of the dune buggies in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_3][Jak 3]].

** Setup
Clone and init submodules for dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/makuto/spargus-vehicle-prototype
#+END_SRC

Jam is used to build the project. Install Jam:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install jam
#+END_SRC

*** SFML Setup
SFML is used for graphics, window, and input. I used my old [[https://github.com/makuto/base2.0][base2.0]] library to wrap SFML if I ever want to switch to SDL (I should dump base2.0 eventually...) 

Running ~BuildDependencies.sh~ will build base2.0. You will need to have installed SFML 2 already. (*TODO:* Add instructions on how to do this)

*** Bullet3 Setup
Spargus Vehicle Prototype uses [[https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3][Bullet3]] for physics.

Build bullet3:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd spargus-vehicle-prototype
./BuildDependencies.sh
#+END_SRC

/Optional:/ Test the examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./bullet3/build_cmake/examples/ExampleBrowser/App_ExampleBrowser
#+END_SRC
